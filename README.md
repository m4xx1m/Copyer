# Copyer

## Why i create this&
Because I need to sort the files into different folders. 40 in 1st folder, 70 on 2nd folder, etc

## Requirements 
* python3

## Installation:
```
Copy multicp in bin folder (~/.local/bin/ or /bin/)
Grant permissions - chmod +x multicp
```

## How to use:
```
arg 1 - from filder
arg 2 - *.jpg (example)
arg 3 - how many files to copy
arg 4 - to path

Example: multicp photos "*.png" 43 1st_part
                          ^
                          |
                          /
               Allways use quotes because your shell change *.png on files in folder 


P.S. You can get help if enter command multicp without args
```
